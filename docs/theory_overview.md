# Proof-of-Resonance — Theoretical Overview 🔷

This document gives a high-level explanation of the concepts behind  
the Proof-of-Resonance (PoR) framework.

PoR is a computational model designed to evaluate and optimize  
coherence, stability, and harmonic structure in iterative chains of states.

## 1. Core Idea

Traditional ML systems rely on loss minimization.  
PoR instead relies on **resonance maximization** —  
systems evolve toward states with low noise and high harmonic alignment.

## 2. Key Metrics

### ⭐ Stability Score
Measures how stable the chain is relative to variance.  
Low variance → high stability.

### ⭐ Coherence
Circular-statistics-based metric describing how strongly the chain aligns  
around a dominant phase.

### ⭐ Phase-Lock Progress
Shows how quickly iterative updates synchronize the chain’s internal structure.

## 3. Phase-Locking Dynamics

PoR iterations apply harmonic corrections that push the chain  
toward its natural resonant equilibrium.

This tends to:
- denoise signals  
- expose underlying trends  
- align distributed oscillations  
- amplify dominant components

## 4. Applications

PoR can be applied to:
- climate data  
- neural signals  
- trading models  
- generative models  
- robotics stability loops  
- multi-agent communication

## 5. Vision

PoR is intended to become:
- a new interpretability tool  
- a stability-optimization engine  
- a cross-AI coherence measurement standard  
- a scientific framework for harmonic computation
