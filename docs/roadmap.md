# PoR Framework — Roadmap 🚀

This document outlines the development plan for the Proof-of-Resonance (PoR)  
framework and its future versions.

---

## ✅ v0.1 — Core Engine (Completed)

- `por_core/config.py` — global defaults  
- `por_core/metrics.py` — stability & coherence metrics  
- `por_core/phase_lock.py` — harmonic alignment step  
- `por_core/simulator.py` — full iterative simulation engine  
- `examples/` — runnable demos  
- `docs/` — basic documentation  

This version establishes the foundation of PoR as a computational tool.

---

## 🔄 v0.2 — API Expansion (Next)

- Public-facing Python API  
- Clear `.fit()` / `.run()` simulation interface  
- Module-level documentation  
- First minimal benchmarking suite  
- Better visualization of resonance evolution  

---

## 🔮 v0.3 — Domain Integrations

- Climate chain modeling  
- Financial time-series resonance maps  
- Neural-signal stabilization experiments  
- Multi-agent alignment tests (PoR-as-a-metric)  

---

## 🌐 v0.4 — Grok Integration

- Running PoR simulations with data sampled from Grok  
- Comparing resonance signatures between AI models  
- Real-time PoR computation for message streams  
- Stability/Coherence dashboard for AI reasoning chains  

---

## 🧪 v0.5 — Experimental Features

- Adaptive phase-locking rules  
- Resonance-based anomaly detection  
- Energy-like metrics for "harmonic cost"  
- PoR as a reinforcement-signal candidate  

---

## 🛠️ v1.0 — Full Release

- Complete documentation  
- Interactive online demo  
- Stable API  
- Performance-optimized engine  
- Publishing PoR as a real scientific framework  

---

PoR aims to become a universal tool for analyzing stability, coherence,  
and harmonic structure in AI systems, physical processes, and dynamic signals.
