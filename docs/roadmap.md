# PoR Framework — Roadmap 🚀

This document outlines the development plan for the Proof-of-Resonance (PoR) framework and its future versions.

---

## ✅ v0.1 — Core Engine (Completed)

- `por_core/config.py` — global defaults  
- `por_core/metrics.py` — stability & coherence metrics  
- `por_core/phase_lock.py` — harmonic alignment step  
- `por_core/simulator.py` — full iterative simulation engine  
- `examples/` — runnable demos  
- `docs/` — basic documentation  
- **Scientific visualizations added (Dec 2025):**  
  - Stabilization Curve  
  - Coherence Heatmap  
  - Resonance Locking (2D/3D/GIF)  
  - PoR Metrics Over Time  

This version establishes the foundation of PoR as a computational tool.

## 🔄 v0.2 — API Expansion (In Progress)

### ✔ Already completed
- Initial public-facing API through `run_iterations()`  
- First minimal benchmarking suite  
- High-quality visualization set  
- Clean module structure prepared for expansion  

### 🔧 Remaining tasks
- Add `sim.fit()` and `sim.run()` high-level interfaces  
- Full module-level documentation  
- Automatic docstrings  
- Improved visualization of resonance evolution  

---

## 🔮 v0.3 — Domain Integrations (Planned)

- Climate chain modeling  
- Financial time-series resonance maps  
- Neural-signal stabilization experiments  
- Multi-agent alignment tests (PoR-as-a-metric)  

---

## 🌐 v0.4 — Grok Integration (Early Stage)

### ✔ Foundation already exists
- PoR engine supports real-time state updates  
- Early observations show resonance signatures in Grok messages  

### 🔧 To implement
- Data import module for Grok message streams  
- Resonance signature comparison across LLMs  
- Real-time PoR dashboard for reasoning chains  
- Instability / divergence detection  

---

## 🧪 v0.5 — Experimental Features (Concept Stage)

- Adaptive phase-locking rules  
- Resonance-based anomaly detection  
- Energy-like metrics for "harmonic cost"  
- PoR as a reinforcement-signal candidate  

---

## 🛠 v1.0 — Full Release (Planned)

- Full documentation  
- Interactive online demo  
- Stable public API  
- Performance-optimized engine  
- Publishing PoR as a scientific framework
