## 🚀 Overview  
Proof-of-Resonance (PoR) is a novel computational approach that does not rely on traditional loss minimization.
Instead, it operates through resonance optimization, where systems evolve toward:

low noise

high stability

harmonic phase alignment

The PoR Engine already includes the full computational cycle: configuration, metrics, phase-locking, and iterative simulation.

📦 Installation

PoR will soon be available as a Python package (pip install por-core).
For now, you can install it locally:
git clone https://github.com/SemeAIPletinnya/proof-of-resonance-online
cd proof-of-resonance-online
pip install -r requirements.txt
