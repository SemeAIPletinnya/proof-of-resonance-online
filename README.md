## 🌟 Overview

**Proof-of-Resonance (PoR)** is a computational paradigm that does **not** use classic loss minimization.  
Instead, PoR applies **resonance optimization**, where iterative systems evolve toward:

- low noise  
- high stability  
- harmonic phase alignment  

The PoR Engine includes the full computational cycle:  
configuration → metrics → harmonic phase-locking → iterative simulation.

PoR is designed for:

- AI research  
- dynamical systems  
- climate & geophysical modeling  
- ML training stability  
- multi-agent coherence analysis

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SemeAIPletinnya/proof-of-resonance-online
cd proof-of-resonance-online
pip install -r requirements.txt
from por_core.simulator import ResonanceSimulator

sim = ResonanceSimulator(chain_length=64)
print("Initial chain sample:", sim.chain[:10], "…")
sim.run_iterations(200)
print("Final chain sample:", sim.chain[:10], "…")
from por_core.metrics import stability_score, coherence

print("Stability:", stability_score(sim.chain))
print("Coherence:", coherence(sim.chain))
Initial chain sample: [0.91, -1.03, 0.22, …]
Final chain sample:   [0.11, 0.12, 0.10, …]
Stability: 0.982  
Coherence: 0.913
