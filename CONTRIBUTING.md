# Contributing to Proof-of-Resonance (PoR)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Proof-of-Resonance framework!
PoR is an open prototype designed to explore stability, coherence, and
resonance-based reasoning in AI systems.  
We welcome contributions from researchers, engineers, and curious builders.

## 📌 How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Click **Fork**, create your own copy, and work on a separate branch:

### 2. Follow the Coding Standards
- Use clear naming.
- Keep functions small and explicit.
- Add docstrings for every model, metric, or test.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions.

### 3. Tests for Any New Logic
If your contribution affects:
- Drift detection  
- Phase alignment  
- Coherence metrics  
- Stability functions  

Then include a simple reproducible test.

### 4. Submit a Pull Request
Before submitting:
- Describe what problem your change solves.  
- Provide minimal reproducible examples.  
- Link to any related Issues.

PRs lacking description or motivation may be returned for clarification.

## 🧪 Adding New Metrics or Models

If you're adding a new **stability metric**, please include:
- Mathematical intuition  
- Expected range  
- Failure modes  
- Example usage  

If you're adding a **new resonance model**, include:
- Description of oscillator / alignment logic  
- Comparison to existing methods
